Which of the following statement is incorrect about anonymous inner class?


 Single Choice - Select one correct answer from the options list. 
         
 
 

 
 ? 


Anonymous inner classes have no name, and their type must be either a
subclass of the named type or an implementer of the named interface.



 
 ? 


Because of polymorphism, the only methods you can call on an anonymous inner class 
reference are those defined in the reference variable class (or interface), even though 
the anonymous class is really a subclass or implementer of the reference variable type



 
 ? 


An anonymous inner class can extend more than one subclass or implement more than one
interface. 



 
 ? 


An anonymous inner class is always created as part of a statement; don't forget to close 
the statement after the class definition with a curly brace. This is a rare case in Java, 
a curly brace followed by a semicolon.
